 I am Ofei-Badu William. I am an eighteen year old student in the Computer Engineering Department of <b>KNUST</b>.
 I am a native of <b>Aburi-Mampong</b> though currently I reside in the vicinity of <b>Obuasi</b>. Throughout my life,
 I have been a <b>Christian</b>. I come from a staunch Christian household as a result of my father being a Reverend
 Minister, Pastor Seth Asare Ofei-Badu. As such I love God and take my Christian life very seriously. My mother
 is a teacher who works in the government sector. By deduction, my upbringing was geared heavily towards good 
 morals and discipline. Due to this, I consider myself as one who has undergone holistic training.

 In terms of my educational background, there isn't much to say yet. I am a proud old boy of <b>St. Peter's Senior
 High School</b>. I read General Science with Biology as an elective. So as it stands now, the real question is:
 "Why Computer Engineering"

        <h2><ins>WHY COMPUTER ENGINEERING</ins></h2>
    <pre>
I did not want to pursue this course initially despite my inherent knack for the course. I wanted to become a medical
doctor so that I would finally be respected. That childish idealogy changed when I picked a course to read in
university. I realised that I was more keen on picking Computer Engineering as a second choice than I was about my first
choice. God being the decider of one's chosen path, I got the course and the rest is history. I have never been happier.
Though the stress associated is very much present but honestly, I wouldn't want to do anything else.
